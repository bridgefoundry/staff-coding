##Interview One: White Boarding   
**Date:** 11/25/15  
**Candidate Name:** Laura Kirby  
**Description:** Candidate will work through a white-boarding challenge with at least one Mentor. All participants should feel relaxed, as this mostly just an opportunity to begin working together.  

**Prompt:**  
* Part 1: We have two independent code bases for two websites. We want to pull data from Website A and display it on Website B. How would we do this?  
* Part 2: The data will be used for a graph on the front-end of Website B. Suppose you were to build the routes for Website A, what would they look like?  
* Part 3: When making a request for the data, what type of response would you expect to receive? Can you begin modeling/outlining that data?  
  * Part 3A: Are there ways to optimize the API?  
* Part 4: What technologies will be involved when creating the chart on Website B and why?   
* Part 5: Technical question - TBD  
  * Sarah: What happens when you write a route/URL and press enter?  
  * Jessie: How does routing work in Rails?  

**Done Well:**  
* Demonstrates general understanding of how a Rails application works. 

**Room for Improvement:**  
* Thorough understanding of HTTP request/response protocol  

**Needs work before moving forward:**  
*  

**Technologies/code bases Candidate will need to learn before moving forward:**   
* BridgeTroll.org  
* BridgeFoundry.org  
* Jekyll   
* JS Graphing Framework   
* JS Testing on frontend

**Next Steps:**  
* Build a small sample of what the implementation will look like  
* Create an issue on the BridgeTroll repo, mark it "discussion", and write up a proposal for Lili and Trevor to review  

**Notes:**  
*
