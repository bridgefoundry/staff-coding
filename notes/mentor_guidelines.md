- An ideal mentor:
  - is able to check-in with mentee twice a week (e.g. via Screenhero, Google Hangout, or Phone).
  - has many years of industry experience.
  - enjoys teaching and learning from junior developers.
  - feels that she/he is contributing to a valuable cause.
  - is excited to be part of an open source and volunteer based community.
  - understands that both parties have something to gain from paring.
  - holds mentee accountable by setting expectations.
  - is clear about setting definite goals and agreeing upon such goals with mentee (e.g. mentor and mentee create a board on Trello to track tasks).
  - is optimistic about mentee's ability to learn and progress made.
  - allows mentee to voice questions and concerns without feeling as though her/his tactics are being questioned.
  - has professional experience with said technology (e.g. Ruby on Rails).
  - provides constructive criticism.

- Not so ideal mentor:
  - is only able to respond to mentee via email (i.e. unable to meet for live pairing via Screenhero or in-person).

On a personal note: I'm excited to be working with women! They are great role models and show me that it is possible to achieve what they have in my own career. Additionally, I have had very few opportunities to pair and/or learn from women.
