##Interview Two: Coding Challenge  
**Date:** 11/25/15
**Candidate Name:** Laura Kirby  
**Description:** Work with a senior developer to discuss and pair program on solving a specific problem.  

**Prompt:**  
* Part 1: Similar to the game Zork, we are going to create a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. The Game has Locations and Directions, use the whiteboard to diagram how you begin modeling this code. Remember to keep your code object oriented.    
* Part 2: We are going to use test-driven-development. What is the first thing we will want to write a test for? 
	* Part 2A: Give an example of what is the "it" should statement would say. 
	* Part 2B: Give an example of what would be evaluated for "expect."
* Part 3: Now that we have a test passing for Game. How will we add a Location?   
	* Part 3A: Give an example of what is the "it" should statement would say. 
	* Part 3B: Give an example of what would be evaluated for "expect."
* Part 4: Now that we have a passing test for Location. Go back to the whiteboard and diagram how Direction will be implemented.    
* Part 5: Without writing code, explain how you would store and access instances of Location and Direction. 

**Done Well:**  
* Demonstrates general understanding of testing workflow. Talking through the problem. 

**Room for Improvement:**
